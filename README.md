## Interactions with Back End

Currently all the back end interactions are mocked out. The front end expects all data to be passed via JSON. There are currently two mocked out interactions, [fetching groups of questions](#fetching-groups-of-questions), and [processing the user's answers](#processing-the-userss-answers).

### Fetching groups of questions

The front end expects that it will recieve a **QuestionGroup** JSON array with the following schema:

```
Array of QuestionGroups

[
    {
        groupId: Number,
        title: String,
        questions: [
            {
                questionId: Number,
                title: String,
                multipleChoice: Boolean (optional)
                answers: [
                    {
                        answerId: Number,
                        title: String
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

In english, each **QuestionGroup** has an ID, a title, and an array of **Questions**. Each **Question** also has an ID and a title, as well as an optional field `multipleChoice` which, when true, will allow the user to select multiple answers. Each **Question** also has an array of **Answers** which each have an ID and a title.

An example of one of these **QuestionGroup** arrays can be found [here](./src/data/mockQuestions.js).

### Processing the users's answers

When the user completes the quiz, they post an array of **AnswerGroups** back to the sever. An **AnswerGroup** is identical to a **QuestionGroup** except that there is an additional field `answer` on each question whose value is an array of the indices of the chosen answers.

An example of on of these **AnswerGroup** arrays can be found [here](./src/data/mockAnswers.js).

After posting to the back end, the front end will expect a JSON array of **Results** where each **Result** represents an activist movement as a response from the back end with the following schema:

```
Array of Results

[
    {
        resultId: Number,
        name: String,
        description: String (optional),
        websiteLink: String (url) (optional),
        donateLink: String (url) (optional),
        image: String (url) (optional)
    }
]
```

An example of an array of **Results** can be found [here](./src/data/mockResults.js).

## Code Style

- Indentation: 2 spaces
- Wrap lines at 80 characters
- Component CSS class names always start with `Component-` to avoid collisions
- Opt for descriptive variables names, intentional whitespace, and self-explanatory code over verbose comments
